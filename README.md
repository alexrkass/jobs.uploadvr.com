# jobs.uploadvr.com
JS footer and custom CSS to overhaul functionality of jobs.uploadvr.com 

These files are the final version of a frontend overhaul of jobs.uploadvr.com. All changes were ideated by myself, a UX designer, and the CEO, and 99% of code architecture and implementation is my own work. 

#Modifications include:

overhauled search functionality: the default job filters were replaced with an AJAX implementation of the jQuery Chosen dropdown plugin.

parallax banner: implemented with parallax.js, a jQuery plugin.

nav bar: to match the look+feel of the main site (uploadvr.com). Responds to application state (logged in or out)

modal window: signup CTA triggered when the user clicks a job listing

#Miscellaneous improvements:

Async importing of Google Webfonts + favicon

View optimization using Bootstrap grid classes
